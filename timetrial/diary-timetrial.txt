Cloned to laptop (old folder renamed to 160209)

Previous methods not working. Now I'm trying to store data in a dictionary of list like Amanda: 0,0,0
Problem is the dictionary is a dictionary of tuples. 
Finally found problem with tuples: needed to initialise as list i.e. : [0,0,0] instead of 0,0,0
should be able to carry on from here.
